## The two functions below, makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve will cache 
## the inverse of a matrix if the inverse of that specific vector has not
## yet been calculated. If the inverse has been calculated and cached, it
## will return the cached result.

## MakeCacheMatrix will create a list of functions that will allow us
## to cache the inverse of a vector.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## CacheSolve will use the list created in he MakeCacheMatrix function
## to caluclate the inverse of a matrix, or if it has already been 
## calculated, returned the cached result.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
